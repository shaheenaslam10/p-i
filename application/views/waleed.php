Resolved
1. May be admin's request mechanism is missing. If admin press Add Request button on request's, request seems to be added but no data. 
    I think in case of admin, his own request must be shown in separate page.
    2. In requests page of admin, white spaces shows, means tabale row is printing but data is not loading.
    3. when status changed by admin to "in Progress", error shown in status field of employee.
    4. Requisition slip either added by admin or user, the user of requisition slip must not b changed. Admin is changing user, attached to requisition slip while editig slip.
    5. Admin must not allowed to delete requisition slip.
    6. Show requisitions slip approval/reject status to super admin.
    7. Remove "Add Requisition Slip" button from super admin.
    8. Admin created requisition slip for his stock, and added 1 item in RS detail, but did not added items. super admin approved, after that he added more RS details of 1000000 worth, or deleted some items, did any CRUD. which is note correct.
    9. If admnin created a slip and applied for approval, after super admin approve, the options of update, delete and add RS details must not visible.
    10. when admin add requisition slip for his stock, then add items in slip, there must not the option of allot. because the user not associated.
